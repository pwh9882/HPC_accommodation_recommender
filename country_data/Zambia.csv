ZM,Zambia,125481,Livingstone,1190489,Chundukwa River Lodge,All,Livingstone Livingstone ,,"Chundukwa was built in 1992 by Doug and his Dad. Once a base camp for Dougs mobile safaris into various National Parks in Zambia, Botswana and Namibia. It became increasingly more popular as a place to relax and enjoy the tranquility of bush and river life. Whilst the lodge was rented out for a few years it is back in the hands  of its owners who are firmly at the helm. 
A total revamp took place in January 2015 with ongoing upgrades.
We like to see the mundane becoming a springboard for the miraculous and are sincerely grateful to have an opportunity to share this river paradise with guests who often times become friends. 
We genuinely love to make all our guests feel special and cared for - without the fuss. With our sights set firmly on service and comfort, each guest is garunteed personalised care and attention. On any given day you will find Doug in the kitchen, up a ladder or on a horse, and Gail baking puddings and doing the reservations. The bush, the bird life and menagerie of animals both wild and domestic keep us and guests entertained. If this is to your liking you will surely love staying in this wonderful relaxed, idyllic atmosphere. Chundukwa River Lodge in Livingstone is situated right on the Zambezi River, offering rooms with panoramic views of the river, natural surroundings and native wildlife. The lodge offers a swimming pool and a sunset river cruise.

The rooms include safari-style décor and come with walk-in mosquito nets and private bathrooms. Wi-Fi is available in public areas at a charge.

With a capacity for only 16 guests at a time, the lodge offers an intimate holiday experience. Guests can enjoy activities such as canoeing on the Zambezi River, sunset river cruises or horse riding. Meals are served in the main lodge.

Chundukwa River Lodge is just 30 km upstream from the Victoria Falls and 60 km from Chobe National Park. Livingstone Airport is 28 km away.
